## Mirror Depth Checker for Bronica S2A

![bronicaViewfinderAdapter](https://github.com/Archive-663/bronicaS2A/blob/main/ASSETS/PHOTO/PRODUCT/1%20(2).jpg)

### Features:
- Adjustable depth gauge to determine if rear lens element will hit the mirror

### How to use:
If you have a lens you'd like to try to adapt to the S2A simply download and modify the 30mm Disc to the diameter of the rear lens element of your lens. Then you can adjust the depth screw into the camera body, verifying when the rear element would hit the mirror. Lock the screw with the jam nut when that distance has been reached and remove the depth checker.

Take measurements from the rear element to the lens flange for a rough length that can be used to determine a base design for a lens adapter. 

### What would be helpful:
- a set of microfiles

### Printing help:
Filament recommendation:
- ABS
- PETG

Generally, all my designs have chamfers on the print face of the STL. You can reference the supplied 'printOrientation' .3mf files for suggested print orientation.

### Assembly help:
Clean up support remains. Screw on the Disc to one end of the screw. Then using a jam nut lock the disc in place. Screw on the lens mount and then a jam nut.
